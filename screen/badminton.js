                        The feet of both players must remain in a stationary position until the serve is made. Your feet can not be touching the line at this time.
                        It is not a fault if you miss the shuttle while serving.The shuttle cannot be caught and slung with the racket.
                        A player cannot hold his racket near the net to ward off a downward stroke by his opponent or to interfere with his racket.</Text>
